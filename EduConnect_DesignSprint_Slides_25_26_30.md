# EduConnect – UpShift Design Sprint Results (Slides 25, 26, 30)

Based on the **i-Upshift Design Sprint Slides Updated** deck and the EduConnect project (study partner platform).

## Slide 25: PHASE 1 – Activity 1-1 | PROBLEM TREE (Your Result)

**Instructions (from slides):**  
- **Trunk** = core problem  
- **Roots** = causes of the problem  
- **Branches** = effects/consequences of the problem  

### Problem Tree for EduConnect

| Part | Content |
|------|--------|
| **PROBLEM (trunk)** | Students struggle to find compatible study partners and stay motivated when studying alone. |
| **CAUSES (roots)** | • No single platform that matches students by interests, skills, and learning style<br>• Lack of visibility into who has similar academic goals and schedules<br>• Existing tools focus on courses or social links, not academic compatibility<br>• No structured way to combine matching with study tracking and resources<br>• Difficulty coordinating study times and preferences with peers |
| **EFFECTS (branches)** | • Lower motivation and engagement in self-study<br>• Missed collaboration and peer-learning opportunities<br>• Ineffective or inconsistent study habits<br>• Feelings of isolation when studying<br>• Slower progress and lower retention of material |

You can draw this as a tree: one box for the problem (trunk), several roots for causes, and several branches for effects.

## Slide 26: PHASE 1 – Activity 1-1 | PROBLEM TREE (Visual / Diagram)

Slide 26 in the deck is image-only (the Problem Tree **example** diagram). For **your** result:

Use the same structure as in **Slide 25** and turn it into a **visual Problem Tree** for EduConnect:

- **Center (trunk):**  
  *"Students struggle to find compatible study partners and stay motivated when studying alone."*
- **Below (roots – causes):**  
  List each cause on a separate root (e.g. “No platform for interest/skill matching”, “No visibility of peers’ goals/schedules”, “Tools don’t focus on academic compatibility”, “No combined matching + tracking + resources”, “Hard to coordinate study times”).
- **Above (branches – effects):**  
  List each effect on a separate branch (e.g. “Lower motivation”, “Missed collaboration”, “Ineffective study habits”, “Isolation”, “Slower progress”).

So: **Slide 25** = the written Problem Tree table; **Slide 26** = the same content as a diagram (your EduConnect tree).

## Slide 30: PHASE 1 – Activity 1-1 | 5 WHYs? (Your Result)

**Format:** Start from a clear problem statement, then ask “Why?” and give one reason; repeat until you have 5 “Why?” questions and answers (root cause).

### 5 Whys for EduConnect

| # | Question | One reason |
|---|----------|------------|
| **1** | Why do students often fail to find good study partners? | Because they don’t know who has similar interests, skills, and study preferences. |
| **2** | Why don’t they know who has similar interests and preferences? | Because there is no single place that collects these preferences and shows compatible peers. |
| **3** | Why is there no such place? | Because most tools are either generic social networks (no academic matching) or tied to one course (no cross-course, interest-based matching). |
| **4** | Why don’t those tools offer interest/skill-based matching? | Because building a matching system (collecting preferences, defining similarity, ranking recommendations) is complex and not their main focus. |
| **5** | Why is that a gap? | Because few products combine user profiles, weighted compatibility, study tracking, and resources in one platform—which is exactly what EduConnect addresses. |

**Root cause (in one line):**  
The gap EduConnect solves is the lack of a dedicated platform that combines profile-based compatibility matching with study tracking and learning resources.

## Summary

- **Slide 25:** Problem Tree for EduConnect (problem + causes + effects) in table form.  
- **Slide 26:** Same content as a **diagram** (trunk = problem, roots = causes, branches = effects).  
- **Slide 30:** 5 Whys for EduConnect (five “Why?” questions and one reason each), leading to the root cause above.

All answers are aligned with EduConnect’s goals: connecting students with compatible study partners, tracking study progress, and providing learning resources and study groups.
