Her parents took her to a local health center where she was diagnosed with a waterborne disease. The doctor explained to her parents that the cause of her illness was likely due to poor hygiene practices such as not washing her hands before eating or after using the toilet. Nankunda's parents were shocked and saddened by the news, as they had always tried to provide a clean and healthy environment for their children.Impact: Nankunda's illness caused her to miss several days of school, and her parents had to spend money on medical treatment and transportation to the health center.
